The other day i was walking with a friend, what were we talking about?
Something about a silly printer that every n day stopped working.
And it that moment of effortless, daily, chit chat we use to have, there was this ... guy, proomtply interrumping us,
as if he chose to stand between both of us with no introduction. 
When do you guys finish your shift?,  he said 

See, when one reads this out of place question, in a  moment and time far away from the common hurries of the day to day, 
its easy to foresee where its going.

its none of your business, or in a more amicable way, "you should ask our manager",  would have sufficed...

But no, no, i ve said "I am leaving at 5pm". Which, technically speaking is not true, i use to leave 5:20, there s always that pesky detail that needs to be done.

And thats where i went wrong. oh boy i did! See, he went nuclear, rambling about IT working hours, how we didnt have enough will to work..
I was paralized at the moment, as if a lightning had struck me in a sunny day. What was this person, i barely know, trying to tell me?

First of all, he was shouting from far away, i could barely hear him. 

Second, we were at the front desk of an hotel.. The place is as important as the message, and if its something essential needs to be said, why say it aloud, in the open, in a so overly harsh tone? Nothing product can come out of it.
